GraphRAG is a retrieval system that builds a knowledge graph from text. It extracts entities like Microsoft and
OpenAI, then links them through relationships such as partnership and research collaboration. In 2023, Microsoft
invested in OpenAI to accelerate AI research. OpenAI builds large language models and deploys them via Azure.
Azure provides GPU infrastructure, and GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI models. Satya Nadella leads Microsoft,
while Sam Altman leads OpenAI. Together, the companies publish research papers, improve safety, and scale
responsible AI deployments across products like Bing Chat and GitHub Copilot.
