-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
 
-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [{entity_types}]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as a JSON object: {"name": "<entity_name>", "type": "<entity_type>", "description": "<entity_description>"}
 
2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as a JSON object: {"source": "<source_entity>", "target": "<target_entity>", "description": "<relationship_description>", "strength": <relationship_strength>}

3. Return output in English as a single JSON object with this exact shape:
{
  "entities": [
    {"name": "<entity_name>", "type": "<entity_type>", "description": "<entity_description>"}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"source": "<source_entity>", "target": "<target_entity>", "description": "<relationship_description>", "strength": <relationship_strength>}
  ]
}

4. Respond with only valid JSON. Do not include prose, explanations, code fences, tuple delimiters, record delimiters, or completion markers.

Text:
TechGlobal's (TG) stock skyrocketed in its opening day on the Global Exchange Thursday. But IPO experts warn that the semiconductor corporation's debut on the public markets isn't indicative of how other newly listed companies may perform.

TechGlobal, a formerly public company, was taken private by Vision Holdings in 2014. The well-established chip designer says it powers 85% of premium smartphones.

{
  "entities": [
    {"name": "TECHGLOBAL", "type": "ORGANIZATION", "description": "TechGlobal is a stock now listed on the Global Exchange which powers 85% of premium smartphones."},

Five Aurelians jailed for 8 years in Firuzabad and widely regarded as hostages are on their way home to Aurelia.

The swap orchestrated by Quintara was finalized when $8bn of Firuzi funds were transferred to financial institutions in Krohaara, the capital of Quintara.

The exchange initiated in Firuzabad's capital, Tiruzia, led to the four men and one woman, who are also Firuzi nationals, boarding a chartered flight to Krohaara.

They were welcomed by senior Aurelian officials and are now on their way to Aurelia's capital, Cashion.

The Aurelians include 39-year-old businessman Samuel Namara, who has been held in Tiruzia's Alhamia Prison, as well as journalist Durke Bataglani, 59, and environmentalist Meggie Tazbah, 53, who also holds Bratinas nationality.
